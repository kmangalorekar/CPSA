# CPSA
Protocol modelling and verification of security algorithms using CPSA (Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer)

Reference link to CPSA code and documentation : [MITRE CPSA](https://github.com/mitre/cpsa)

The following protocols were modelled and analyzed:
1. [Needham Schoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needham-Schroeder_protocol)
2. [Pake0 and Pake1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)
3. [Deffie Helman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
4. [SRP-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol#Implementations)

As part of a semster course with collaboration with InsureHub project, the [5G-EAP-TLS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8970242) protocol initial handshake was modelled and analyzed (Spring 2021 UTD MSCS)
* EAP TLS v1.2
* EAP TLS v1.3
